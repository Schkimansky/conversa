# Library
This is a easy to use python library that allows you to convert units of measurement to others. 
For example, You can use the "convert_time" function to convert seconds to minutes. 
```python
convert_time(90,  From="seconds",  To="minutes")
```

# In Beta
Library under construction. If you notice any errors between conversions or a commonly used unit isnt supported, Please open an issue!
Currently under testing phase before first stable release.
