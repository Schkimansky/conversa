# Library
This is a easy to use python library that allows you to convert units of measurement to others. 
For example, You can use the "time" function to convert seconds to minutes. 
```python
import conversa
result = conversa.time(90,  From="seconds",  To="minutes") # Output will be 1.5 minutes (1.5 as a integer)
print(result)
```
